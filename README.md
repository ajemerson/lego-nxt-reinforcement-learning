# Mindstorm Reinforcement Learning
### Brady Coye & Andrew Emerson


## Project Idea:
Developing and comparing various reinforcement learning algorithms on the
Lego Mindstorm robots in attempt to simulate an autonomous vehicle on a small
scale in an obstacle course

## Definitions:
### Obstacle Course: 
The obstacle course is an 8x4ft (subject to change) rectangle
with start and end points on opposite sides. The course will be surrounded by
walls. The course will contain static and variable obstacles. Static obstacles will
remain in the same position after each test. Variable obstacles will be placed
randomly within a set perimeter each test iteration. The course will be constructed
on a flat surface.

The obstacles, walls, and goal of the rectangle will be defined by different color
sticky-notes/tape (i.e. yellow = variable obstacles, red = static obstacles, green =
goal, black = walls). The robot will use visual sensors to determine the colors of
the sticky-notes/tape.

## Functionality:
A Lego Mindstorm robot that shows measurable improvement after successive
obstacle course driving tests by utilizing reinforcement learning algorithms.
○ A data analysis/visualization of the performance improvement and obstacle
course environment information obtained after each test.
○ An improvement rate comparison of each reinforcement algorithm tested. (ex.
Temporal Difference Algorithm, Expectation Maximization Algorithm)
